### Hello

My repos focus on machine learning, statistics, functional programming, puzzle solving, and notes to myself. I tend to program in either python or R. Some repos are full-fledged data science tools and are published outside of github. Others are pet projects.

### Open Source

-   python: [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.
-   R: [dann](https://github.com/gmcmacran/dann) is an implementation of Hastie and Tibshirani’s Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Classification.
-   R: [tidydann](https://github.com/gmcmacran/tidydann) adds the 'dann' model and the 'sub_dann' model to the Tidymodels ecosystem.
-   R: [extendedFamily](https://github.com/gmcmacran/extendedFamily) adds new links to R’s generalized linear models.
-   R: [LRTesteR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/LRTesteR) is a collection of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the likelihood ratio.
-   R: [GlmSimulatoR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/GlmSimulatoR) allows the user to easily and quickly create data for the generalized linear model.

### Example Work

-   python: [microsoftLTR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/microsoftLTR) trains a M.L. model that directly optimizes gain.
-   R: [survivoR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/survivoR) builds time to event models.
-   python: [translator](https://github.com/gmcmacran/translator) translates English to Spanish with tensorflow.
-   python: [semi_supervised_two](https://github.com/gmcmacran/semi_supervised_two) explores the usefulness of semi-supervised machine learning.
-   python: [anomaly_detection](https://github.com/gmcmacran/anomaly_detection) trains multiple anomaly detection models on a simulated dataset.

### Implementing ML Models From Scratch

-   python: [glm_irls](https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_irls) is an implementation of generalized linear models from the ground up using numpy.
-   python: [coord-descent-glm](https://github.com/gmcmacran/coord-descent-glm) is an implementation of generalized linear models using coordinate descent and functional programming.

### Simulation Studies

-   R: [TypeOneTypeTwoSim](https://github.com/gmcmacran/TypeOneTypeTwoSim) is a simulation of type I error rates, type II error rates, and coverage rates of functions in LRTesteR.
-   R: [geometric_likelihood_ratio](https://github.com/gmcmacran/geometric_likelihood_ratio) explores a distribution where asymptotic theory does not apply.
-   R: [calibration](https://github.com/gmcmacran/calibration) studys calibration of p values from likelihood ratio tests when sample size is small.
-   R: [normalTestsCompare](https://github.com/gmcmacran/normalTestsCompare) compares power of Gaussian goodness of fit tests.
-   R: [bayesian_p_values](https://github.com/gmcmacran/bayesian_p_values) studies how changing the prior distribution's parameters affects p value calculations.

### Functional Programming

-   R: [functional_playground](https://github.com/gmcmacran/functional_playground) contains odds and ends of functional programming ideas.

### Puzzle Solving

-   python: [backtracking](https://github.com/gmcmacran/backtracking) solving puzzles using backtracking algorithms.
    -   Sudoku puzzles
    -   Knights tour problem
    -   N queens problem
    -   Pizza Hut's pi day challenge.

### Notes

-   R: [glm_notes](https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_notes) is a collection of notes about generalized linear models.
-   pencil: [proofs](https://github.com/gmcmacran/proofs) is a collection of math proofs.
