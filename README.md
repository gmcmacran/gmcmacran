### Hi there

Thanks for visiting my github. My repos tend to be about data science/statistics, functional programming, puzzle solving, and notes to myself. Some repos are published outside of github. Others are pet projects.

### Machine Learning

python: (statsmodels)[https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels]
R: (dann)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/dann] is an implementation of Hastie and Tibshirani’s Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Classification.
python: (glm_irls)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_irls] is an implementation of generalized linear models using iterative reweighted least squares and O.O.P.
R: (extendedFamily)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/extendedFamily] adds new links to R’s generalized linear models.
python: (coord-descent-glm)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/coord-descent-glm] is an implementation of generalized linear models using coordant descent and functional programming.
python: (tensorflow)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/tensorflow] is example tensorflow models.
python: (aws_docker_py)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/aws_docker_py] is a containerized model in AWS. 

### Hypothesis Testing

R: (LRTesteR)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/LRTesteR] is a collection of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the likelihood ratio.

### Simulation Studies

R: (TypeOneTypeTwoSim)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/TypeOneTypeTwoSim] is simulation of type I error rates, type II error rates, and coverage rates of functions in LRTesteR. 
R: (normalTestsCompare)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/normalTestsCompare] compares power of Gaussian goodness of fit tests. 

### Data Creation

R: (GlmSimulatoR)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/GlmSimulatoR] allows the user to easily and quickly create data for the generalized linear model. 
python: (datasets-friedman-1994)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/datasets-friedman-1994] implements simulated dataset algorithms from Friedman (1994).

### Functional Programming

R: (functional_playground )[https://github.com/gmcmacran/functional_playground] is odds and ends of functional programming ideas.
R: (altForm)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/altForm] is alternative formulations of statistical functions.

### Puzzle Solving

python: (backtracking)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/backtracking] solving puzzles using backtracking algorithms.

### Notes

R: (glm_notes)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_notes] is a collection of notes about generalized linear models. 
python: (interviewQuestions)[https://github.com/gmcmacran/interviewQuestions] is a collection of technical programming questions I have been asked during data science interviews.
