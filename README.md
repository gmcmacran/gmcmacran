### Hello

Thanks for visiting my github page. My repos focus on machine learning, statistics, functional programming, puzzle solving, and notes to myself. I tend to program in either python or R. Some repos are full-fledged data science tools and are published outside of github. Others are pet projects.

### Machine Learning

* python: [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.
* R: [dann](https://github.com/gmcmacran/dann) is an implementation of Hastie and Tibshirani’s Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Classification.
* python: [microsoftLTR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/microsoftLTR) trains a M.L. model that directly optimizes gain.
* R: [extendedFamily](https://github.com/gmcmacran/extendedFamily) adds new links to R’s generalized linear models.
* python: [glm_irls](https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_irls) is an implementation of generalized linear models from the ground up using numpy.
* python: [coord-descent-glm](https://github.com/gmcmacran/coord-descent-glm) is an implementation of generalized linear models using coordinate descent and functional programming.
* python: [tensorflow](https://github.com/gmcmacran/tensorflow) contains examples of 
    + two versions of a generative adversarial network
    + transfer learning 
    + data augmentation
    + functional A.P.I. with a residual connection
    + auto encoder
* python: [aws_docker_py](https://github.com/gmcmacran/aws_docker_py) is a containerized model in AWS. 
* python: [semi_supervised_two](https://github.com/gmcmacran/semi_supervised_two) explores the usefulness of semi-supervised machine learning.
* python: [feature_selection](https://github.com/gmcmacran/feature_selection) compares different feature selection methods for machine learning.

### Hypothesis Testing

* R: [LRTesteR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/LRTesteR) is a collection of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the likelihood ratio.

### Simulation Studies

* R: [TypeOneTypeTwoSim](https://github.com/gmcmacran/TypeOneTypeTwoSim) is a simulation of type I error rates, type II error rates, and coverage rates of functions in LRTesteR. 
* R: [normalTestsCompare](https://github.com/gmcmacran/normalTestsCompare) compares power of Gaussian goodness of fit tests. 
* R: [muTestsCompare](https://github.com/gmcmacran/muTestsCompare) compares nonparametric tests for mu. 

### Data Creation

* R: [GlmSimulatoR](https://github.com/gmcmacran/GlmSimulatoR) allows the user to easily and quickly create data for the generalized linear model. 
* python: [datasets-friedman-1994](https://github.com/gmcmacran/datasets-friedman-1994) implements simulated dataset algorithms from Friedman (1994).

### Functional Programming

* R: [functional_playground](https://github.com/gmcmacran/functional_playground) contains odds and ends of functional programming ideas.
* R: [altForm](https://github.com/gmcmacran/altForm) contains alternative formulations of statistical functions.

### Puzzle Solving

* python: [backtracking](https://github.com/gmcmacran/backtracking) solving puzzles using backtracking algorithms.
	+ Sudoku puzzles
	+ Knights tour problem
	+ N queens problem
	+ Pizza Hut's pi day challenge.

### Notes

* R: [glm_notes](https://github.com/gmcmacran/glm_notes) is a collection of notes about generalized linear models. 
* python: [interviewQuestions](https://github.com/gmcmacran/interviewQuestions) is a collection of technical programming questions I have been asked during data science interviews.
* python: [conda_environments](https://github.com/gmcmacran/conda_environments) contains conda commands for my typical conda environments. 
* pencil: [proofs](https://github.com/gmcmacran/proofs) is a collection of math proofs.
